For my implementation, I created 2 new kinds of mobs: structs, and big structs. They each have a huge amount of mass and health (tho the latter doesn't matter as much). I also augmented the base Mod to have a field called 'isStruct'. Using this, I was able to make new mobs that would be seen as 'unaffiliated' by the normal foot units. That way, the foot units wouldn't get distracted and try to attack the river.

As for the collision handling itself, it is fairly straight forward. Following the guidance in the assignment sheet, units on the same team who bump into each other will react differently depending on the masses. By taking into account which direction the units are trying to move, the product of the collision will send them in different directions. Thus, when units are bouncing back and forth between towers, they will actually form a cycle, instead of just bouncing into each other over and over again. By taking the size of the units into account, I was able to minimize how much the units will need to move in order to get around whatever they are colliding with.

When a unit collides with the river, they will be pushed back slightly, and in the direction they are trying to go (on the x axis). The same goes for the towers.

Overall, my approach is effective and works pretty well. I particularly enjoy how the units are able to circle and maneuver around each other. That isn't to say that there are things I don't want to fix and improve, however. My implementation can create some jerky movement at times, and I would really like to smooth it out some. Also, the hitboxes on everything are technically smaller than the actual units appear. This is because the hitboxes are circles with a radius equalling the size of the unit. Because of this, corners sometimes overlap.
